### Quick Start

1. [Download the appropriate binary from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dennischancs/svbony-ai-assistant/releases/latest) for your platform, eg: macOS (x86_64, aarch64/Apple Silicon), Windows (x86_64)
2. Extract the archive
3. Run the binary

## Supported Devices
- SVBONY SVHub Omni2P (PID: 0x5053)
- SVBONY SVHub M6 (PID: 0x364d)

## Introduction
The SVBONY AI Assistant is a tool designed to monitor the AI button press events on supported SVBONY devices and execute configured actions such as opening URLs, running commands, sending keystrokes (placeholder), or displaying notifications. This tool supports Windows and macOS systems and can be configured to start automatically on system boot.

## Features
- Monitor AI button press events on the SVBONY SVHub Omni2P and M6 devices.
- Support multiple actions: open URLs, run commands, send keystrokes (placeholder), display notifications.
- Support running in the background (daemon) or foreground (with logs).
- Automatic startup on system boot (configurable, and auto-setup on first run if enabled).
- Single instance check in background mode.
- Graceful shutdown via system signals (Ctrl+C, SIGTERM).
- Detailed configuration and logging.
- Cross-platform notification support (Windows Toast, macOS osascript).

## Installation and Usage

### Installation from Pre-compiled Binaries
If you don't want to compile the code yourself, you can directly download the pre-compiled binaries and follow these steps:
1. Download the binary file suitable for your operating system.
2. Extract the downloaded file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted directory.
4. Run the `svbony-ai-assistant` command to start the program.

### Compilation from Source Code
If you want to compile the program from source code, you can follow these steps:

#### Environment Preparation
Ensure that you have installed the Rust development environment. If not, you can download and install it from the [Rust official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

#### Clone the Code Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dennischancs/svbony-ai-assistant.git
cd svbony-ai-assistant
```

#### Compile the Program
```bash
cargo build --release
```
After compilation, the executable file will be located in the `target/release` directory.

### Run the Program
After compilation, you can run the program using the following command:
```bash
./target/release/svbony-ai-assistant
```

## Command Line Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `-f, --foreground` | Run in foreground mode, displaying all log messages in the console and keeping the application attached to the terminal. Suitable for debugging or manual monitoring. |
| `-b, --background` | Run in background mode as a daemon process. The application will detach from the terminal and run silently in the background. This is the default behavior when launched from a GUI. |
| `--enable-autostart` | Configure the application to start automatically when the system boots. This will create the necessary autostart entries for your operating system. |
| `--disable-autostart` | Remove the application from automatic startup. The application will not start automatically when the system boots. |
| `-c, --show-config` | Display the current configuration file path and contents, then exit without starting the monitoring service. |
| `-r, --regenerate-config` | Reset configuration files to factory defaults. If system config exists, it will be backed up to the executable directory as config.json.old before being replaced. All config.json files will be reset to factory defaults. |
| `-v, --verbose` | Enable verbose logging output. This will show debug messages and detailed information about device communication. |
| `-q, --quiet` | Run in quiet mode, suppressing all log output except for error messages. |
| `-V, --version` | Display version information. |

### Example Usage
```bash
# Run in foreground mode with verbose logging
./target/release/svbony-ai-assistant --foreground --verbose

# Run in background mode and enable automatic startup
./target/release/svbony-ai-assistant --enable-autostart
./target/release/svbony-ai-assistant

# Display the current configuration
./target/release/svbony-ai-assistant --show-config

# Regenerate default configuration files
./target/release/svbony-ai-assistant --regenerate-config
```

## Action Types
- `OpenUrl`: Open a URL in the default browser.
- `RunCommand`: Run a system command with optional arguments.
- `SendKeys`: (Placeholder) Simulate key presses (not yet implemented).
- `ShowNotification`: Show a system notification with title and message.

## Configuration File
The configuration file is used to define the behavior and actions of the application. The configuration file can be located in the following locations:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\SVBONY-AI-Assistant\config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/SVBONY-AI-Assistant/config.json`
- Or `config.json` in the same directory as the executable file

If the configuration file does not exist, the application will use the default configuration and create a configuration file in the above location.

### Configuration File Example
```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "Open app.notta.ai",
      "action_type": "OpenUrl", // Options: OpenUrl, RunCommand, SendKeys, ShowNotification
      "parameters": {
        "url": "https://app.notta.ai",
        "command": null,
        "args": null,
        "keys": null,
        "message": null,
        "title": null
      },
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Show AI Assistant Notification",
      "action_type": "ShowNotification",
      "parameters": {
        "url": null,
        "command": null,
        "args": null,
        "keys": null,
        "message": "AI Assistant activated!",
        "title": "SVBONY AI Assistant"
      },
      "enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "auto_start": true,
    "minimize_to_tray": true,
    "log_level": "info",
    "check_updates": true
  },
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

### Version Compatibility

The configuration file includes a `version` field that matches the application version. When you upgrade the application:

- If the configuration file version doesn't match the application version, the application will automatically:
  1. Back up the existing configuration to `config.json.old`
  2. Create a new configuration file with factory default settings
- This ensures compatibility between your configuration and the application version
- Old settings can still be found in the backup file if needed

## Automatic Startup Configuration
- If `auto_start` is enabled in the config, the application will attempt to set up autostart on first run.
- You can also manually enable/disable autostart via `--enable-autostart` and `--disable-autostart`.

## Notifications
- **Windows**: Uses Toast notifications (PowerShell), with fallback to balloon notifications.
- **macOS**: Uses `osascript` for system notifications.

## Troubleshooting
- **Logging**: You can use the `--verbose` argument to enable verbose logging for better troubleshooting.
- **Single Instance Check**: If the application fails to start in background mode, it may be because another instance is already running. You can use the `--foreground` argument to start multiple instances for debugging.
- **Configuration File Issues**: If there are issues with the configuration file, you can try deleting the configuration file and restarting the application. The application will use the default configuration and recreate the configuration file.
